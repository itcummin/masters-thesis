Project Plan for Master's Thesis

Start -> Lit Review
	What I will Be Doing:
		Looking for novel problems in the literature related to array signal processing
	What I will Need:
		Places to start looking for unanswered questions in the literature
	Deliverables:
		Paper Lit Review (Draft)
		Beamforming Tutorial to Me
	Time Frame for Lit Review/Bootcamp Completion:
	
Lit Review -> Question
	What I will Be Doing:
		Question Formulation/Development/Revision
		Problem Scope Definition
	What I will Need:
		Keeping the question:
			Novel
			Answerable (Achievable)
	Deliverables:
		Paper Introduction (Draft)
		Paper Lit Review (Draft, focused to Question)
	Time Frame for Completion:
	
Question -> Hypothesis/Simulation
	What I will Be Doing:
		Understanding the problem conceptually
		Developing a model for the situation
		Testing my hypothesis in the model (this would pair nicely with the term project for Sci Comp I with Dr. Gowtham)
		Iterating when my first models/hypotheses aren't right...
	What I will Need:
		Sounding Board:
			Are my assumptions reasonable? What might happen if it turns out they aren't?
			Does my understanding of the situation match with the real world?
			What have I not considered?
		Model Development Support
	Deliverables:
		Paper Model Section (Draft), including:
			Hypothesis Evolution
			Conceptual Understanding
			Model Results
		Paper Analysis Section (Outline, experiment should be similar to simulation)
	Time Frame for Completion:
	
Hypothesis/Simulation -> Experimental Verification
	What I will Be Doing:
		Designing an experiment (based on the simulations) to verify the simulation results
		Acquiring/Setting Up Hardware
		Developing Software
		Calibrating/Validating Instruments
		Running the Experiment
		Analysing the Results
		Iterating...
	What I will Need:
		Experimental Design Advice (does this match my simulation assumptions/have I controlled enough variables?)
		Experiment Debugging Help
	Deliverables:
		Paper Methods Section (Draft)
		Paper Analysis Section (Draft from Outline)
		Paper Results Section
	Time Frame for Completion:
		
Experimental Verification -> Results Interpretation
	What I will Be Doing:
		Comparing experimental and simulated results
			Developing statistical comparisons
			Drawing conclusions from the statistical comparisons
	What I will Need:
		Statistics Double-Check
		Conclusions Double-Check
		Paper Revisions
	Deliverables:
		Paper Conclusions Section (Draft)
		2nd + 3rd ("Final Pre-Review") Draft, All Sections
	Time Frame for Completion:
	
Results Interpretation -> Paper Submission
	What I will Be Doing:
		Submitting Paper for Peer-Review Process
		Responding to Reviewer Feedback
	What I will Need:
		Help Addressing Reviewer Feedback
	Deliverables:
		Paper Accepted for Publication to a Leading Peer-Reviewed Journal
	Time Frame for Completion:
	
Paper Submission -> Thesis Development
	What I will Be Doing:
		Extending my Paper into a Thesis
	What I will Need:
		Suggestions/Requirements for Additional Content
		Continued Editing Support
	Deliverables:
		Thesis Accepted for Publication
	Time Frame for Completion:
